Reviewing Process
==================

To eventually obtain a benchmark that is useful for and usable by the research
community, the review process will somewhat differ from usual paper review processes
*by centering around the code and data submission*.

1. As preparation for the review stage, all anonymized submissions will
   be public on OpenReview. In addition, the organizers will create (anonymized)
   pull requests to the benchmark repository based on the submissions.
   Authors are responsible for preparing their submissions accordingly,
   and documentation for doing this correctly (and testing the
   submission prior to uploading on OpenReview) will be made available
   on the workshop page.


2. In the reviewing phase, reviewers will judge the quality of both
   technical reports (on OpenReview) and submitted code (on GitHub),
   according to the `Evaluation Criteria <call_for_papers.html#evaluation-criteria>`__.

3. After the final decisions, all submissions will be de-anonymized both on OpenReview and on GitHub. 

.. 3. In the discussion phase, authors are allowed to update both their
   technical report and the submitted code.
