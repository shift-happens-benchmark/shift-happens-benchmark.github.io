Building the Community Benchmark 
==================


Post-Submission
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- The `review process <call_for_reviewers.html#reviewing-process>`__ will center around the code and data submission. Including the community in an open review process will be an opportunity to increase chances for later adaptations of the benchmark. The tools that will be made available for facilitating the reviewers' jobs will later be released as open-source tools.

- In parallel to the reviewing phase, the workshop organizers will start running tests on the submitted benchmarks for an extended collection of established vision models.

- While adding comments on OpenReview will be limited to the reviewers, code review (and proposal of improvements) on GitHub is open to the public — this also includes discussion of the data collection process described in the technical report. 

- Public discussion — and community building relevant for the benchmark after the workshop ends — will be encouraged on GitHub.

- In the discussion phase, authors are allowed to update both their technical report and the submitted code.

- After the final decisions, all submissions will be de-anonymized both on OpenReview and on GitHub. 
   
- The review process will ensure that for this final set of camera-ready submissions, a set of datasets with reviewed descriptions (submitted reports), and high-quality code ready to merge into the benchmark will be available. After the camera-ready phase, and after ensuring technical soundness of the submitted pull requests, an initial version of the benchmark will be released that allows for contributing of additional models and techniques, as well as for making suggestions on improving the benchmarks and metrics.
   
- During a `community hackathon <community_benchmark.html#hackathon>`__, the benchmark will be polished.
   
- All accepted submissions will be part of the ``shifthappens`` benchmark suite. This will ensure that after the workshop all benchmarks are accessible to the community.

Community Hackathon
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Two weeks prior to the workshop, a hackathon aimed at
community building around the benchmark will be hosted by the workshop
organizers. For this, discussions will
happen on GitHub, and the community will be able to contribute
changes to the benchmark. The best contributions from this phase will
get a short talk (time depends on the number of contributions) at the
workshop.
   
Ensuring Long-Term Access
